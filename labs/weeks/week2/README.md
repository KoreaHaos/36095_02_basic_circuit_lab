# Diodes & Rectifiers

A diode is a specialized electronic component with two electrodes called the anode and the cathode. Most diodes are made with semiconductor materials such as silicon, germanium, or selenium.[*](https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8&q=diode&oq=Diod&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.2622j0j7)

### Basic Diagram:

* A diode allows elctricity yo flow in one direction but not the other. *(ideally)*
* When the applied in the blocked dirrection the diode will experience [avalanche breakdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_breakdown).

This is a basic example of a diode used in a circuit :

A simulation with a square wave applied, shown in green, and current flow, shown in yellow, can be viewed [here](http://lushprojects.com/circuitjs/circuitjs.html?cct=$+1+0.000005+10.200277308269968+50+5+50%0Aw+336+112+576+112+0%0Aw+336+272+576+272+0%0Ag+576+272+576+384+0%0Av+336+112+336+272+0+2+40+5+0+0+0.5%0Ad+576+112+576+272+1+0.805904783%0Ao+4+64+0+551+5+1.130782121458166e+73+0+-1%0A).

A common use of a diode can be understood by examining a "Half-Wave Rectifier" circuit. The basic circuit looks like this :
