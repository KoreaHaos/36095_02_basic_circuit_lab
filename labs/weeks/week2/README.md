# Diodes & Rectifiers

A diode is a specialized electronic component with two electrodes called the anode and the cathode. Most diodes are made with semiconductor materials such as silicon, germanium, or selenium.[*](https://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome-psyapi2&ion=1&espv=2&ie=UTF-8&q=diode&oq=Diod&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0l5.2622j0j7)

* A diode allows elctricity yo flow in one direction but not the other. *(ideally)*
* When the applied in the blocked dirrection the diode will experience [avalanche breakdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avalanche_breakdown).
